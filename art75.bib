@article{donati_spectropolarimetric_1997,
	abstract = {This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 225 circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards) using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new dedicated automatic software package (called ESprit, which utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed description is given in the paper. For each recorded spectrum, we extract `mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using `least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to a single average line analysis or by 4.5 mag compared with the older technique of Donati et al. in the particular case of a K1 star. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects, namely the weak-line T Tauri star V410 Tau, the pre-main-sequence binary HD 155555, the ZAMS stars AB Dor and LQ Hya, the dwarf flare star CC Eri, the RS CVn systems HR 1099, EI Eri, TY Pyx, CF Tuc, SZ Psc, II Peg, IM Peg and IL Hya, and the FK Com star YY Men. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD 104237. Except on HR 1099 and II Peg, our results represent the first direct field detections ever reported on these objects, and in particular the first direct field detection on as young a star as V410 Tau. Most of the magnetic signatures we detect on cool stars show several sign reversals throughout the line profile, indicating that the parent field structure is rather complex and must feature (as expected) many small-scale magnetic regions of different polarities. For all stars on which Zeeman detections are recorded with sufficient accuracy (namely LQ Hya, CC Eri, HR 1099, EI Eri, II Peg, IL Hya and YY Men), differential least-squares deconvolution from both the blue and the red parts of the spectral domain indicates that the magnetic regions we detect are mostly 500 to 1000 K cooler than, and sometimes at the same temperature as, but never warmer than the surrounding photosphere. Serendipitous results include the first detection (i) of small-amplitude radial velocity variations (1.3kms{\textasciicircum}-1 peak to peak) of the Herbig Ae star HD 104237 with small enough a period (37.5+/-1 min) that they must be due to stellar pulsations and (ii) of the solar-like secondary component of the RS CVn system IL Hya.},

	abstract = {Context. {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is an M supergiant that harbors spots and giant granules at its surface and presents linear polarization of its continuum. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We have previously discovered linear polarization signatures associated with individual lines in the spectra of cool and evolved stars. Here, we investigate whether a similar linearly polarized spectrum exists for {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the spectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach, to investigate the presence of an averaged linearly polarized profile for the photospheric lines. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We have discovered the existence of a linearly polarized spectrum for {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, detecting a rather strong signal (at a few times 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} of the continuum intensity level), both in individual lines and in the LSD profiles. Studying its properties and the signal observed for the resonant Na I D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing depolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear polarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the radiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to interpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two brightness spots and their positions on the surface of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. We show that applying the model to each velocity bin along the Stokes Q and U profiles allows the derivation of a map of the bright spots. We use the Narval linear polarization observations of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} obtained over a period of 1.4 yr to study the evolution of the spots and of the atmosphere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our study of the linearly polarized spectrum of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} provides a novel method for studying the evolution of brightness spots at its surface and complements quasi-simultaneous observations obtained with PIONIER at the VLTI.

@article{chiavassa_radiative_2011,
	abstract = {Context. Red supergiants are massive evolved stars that contribute extensively to the chemical enrichment of our Galaxy. It has been shown that convection in those stars produces large granules that cause surface inhomogeneities and shock waves in the photosphere. The understanding of their dynamics is crucial for unveiling the unknown mass-loss mechanism, their chemical composition, and their stellar parameters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present a new generation of red supergiant simulations with a more sophisticated opacity treatment performed with 3D radiative-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: In the code the coupled equations of compressible hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport are solved in the presence of a spherical potential. The stellar core is replaced by a special spherical inner boundary condition, where the gravitational potential is smoothed and the energy production by fusion is mimicked by a simply producing heat corresponding to the stellar luminosity. All outer boundaries are transmitting for matter and light. The post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D is used to extract spectroscopic and interferometric observables. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We show that if one relaxes the assumption of frequency-independent opacities, this leads to a steeper mean thermal gradient in the optical thin region that strongly affects the atomic strengths and the spectral energy distribution. Moreover, the weaker temperature fluctuations reduce the incertitude on the radius determination with interferometry. We show that 1D models of red supergiants must include a turbulent velocity that is calibrated on 3D simulations to obtain the effective surface gravity that mimics the effect of turbulent pressure on the stellar atmosphere. We provide an empirical calibration of the ad hoc micro- and macroturbulence parameters for 1D models using the 3D simulations: we find that there is no clear distinction between the different macroturbulent profiles needed in 1D models to fit 3D synthetic lines.},

@article{mathias_evolution_2018,
	abstract = {Betelgeuse is an M-type supergiant that presents a circularly polarized (Stokes V) signal in its line profiles, interpreted in terms of a surface magnetic field. The weak circular polarization signal has been monitored over 7.5 years in order to follow its evolution on different timescales, and eventually to determine its physical origin. Linear polarization measurements have also been obtained regularly in the last few years. We used both the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra, which were processed by means of the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) method. In order to ensure the reality of the very weak circular polarization, special care has been taken to limit instrumental effects. In addition, several tests were performed on the Stokes V signal to establish its stellar and Zeeman origin. We confirm the magnetic nature of the circular polarization, pointing to a surface magnetic field of the order of 1G. The Stokes V profiles present variations over different timescales, the most prominent one being close to the long secondary period (LSP; around 2000d for Betelgeuse) often invoked in red evolved stars. This long period is also dominant for all the other Stokes parameters. The circular polarization is tentatively modeled by means of magnetic field concentrations mimicking spots, showing in particular that the velocity associated with each "spot" also follows the long timescale, and that this signal is nearly always slightly redshifted. From the coupled variations of both linear and circular polarization signatures in amplitude, velocity and timescale, we favour giant convection cells as the main engine at the origin of polarization signatures and variations in all the Stokes parameters. This strengthens support for the hypothesis that large convective cells are at the origin of the LSP.},

@article{lopez_ariste_convective_2018,
	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We assess the ability to image the photosphere of red supergiants and, in particular Betelgeuse, through the modelling of the observed linear polarization in atomic spectral lines. We also aim to analyse the resulting images over time, to measure the size and dynamics of the convective structures in these stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Rayleigh scattering polarizes the continuum and spectral lines depolarize it. This depolarization is seen as a linear polarization signal parallel to the radial direction on the stellar disk. Integrated over the disk, it would result in a null signal, except if brightness asymmetries/inhomogeneities are present. This is the basic concept behind our imaging technique. Through several tests and comparisons, we have tried to assess and extend its validity, and to determine what can be learnt unambiguously through it. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The several tests and comparisons performed prove that our technique reliably retrieves the salient brightness structures in the photosphere of Betelgeuse, and should be relevant to other red supergiants. For Betelgeuse, we demonstrate that these structures we infer are convective cells, with a characteristic size of more than 60\% of the stellar radius. We also derive the characteristic upflow and downflow speeds, 22 and 10 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, respectively. We find weak magnetic fields concentrated in the downflow lanes in between granules, similar to the quiet sun magnetism. We follow those convective structures in time. Changes happen on timescales of 1 week, but individual structures can be tracked over 4 yr of observations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The measured characteristics of the convection in Betelgeuse confirm the predictions of numerical simulations in both the strong, supersonic upflows and the size of the convective cells. They also concur in the presence of weak magnetic fields that are completely dominated by the convective flows and constrained to the dark lanes of down-flowing plasma.

	abstract = {Context. Cool giant and supergiant star atmospheres are characterized by 
complex velocity fields originating from convection and pulsation
processes which are not fully understood yet. The velocity fields impact
the formation of spectral lines, which thus contain information on the
dynamics of stellar atmospheres. Aim. The tomographic method allows to
recover the distribution of the component of the velocity field
projected on the line of sight at different optical depths in the
stellar atmosphere. The computation of the contribution function to the
line depression aims at correctly identifying the depth of formation of
spectral lines in order to construct numerical masks probing spectral
lines forming at different optical depths. Methods: The
tomographic method is applied to one-dimensional (1D) model atmospheres
and to a realistic three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamics
simulation performed with CO5BOLD in order to compare their spectral
line formation depths and velocity fields. Results: In 1D model
atmospheres, each spectral line forms in a restricted range of optical
depths. On the other hand, in 3D simulations, the line formation depths
are spread in the atmosphere mainly because of temperature and density
inhomogeneities. Comparison of cross-correlation function profiles
obtained from 3D synthetic spectra with velocities from the 3D
simulation shows that the tomographic method correctly recovers the

The characteristic timescale of the variations is 400 days, while velocities cover a range of {\textasciitilde}9 km s-1. Macroturbulence is constant to about 13\% and does not result from motions on the largest scales, but from motions within the large structures. The line bisectors have predominantly a reversed-C shape. Variations in the shapes of bisectors occur on the 1 km s-1 level and are not obviously connected to their shifts in wavelength.

Linear spectropolarimetry of the atomic lines of the spectrum of Betelgeuse reveals information about the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of brightness in its atmosphere. We model the distribution of plasma and its velocities and use inversion algorithms to fit the observed linear polarization. We obtain the first 3D images of the photosphere of Betelgeuse. Within the limits of the used approximations, we recover vertical convective flows and measure the velocity of the rising plasma at different heights in the photosphere. In several cases, we find this velocity to be constant with height, indicating the presence of forces other than gravity acting on the plasma and counteracting it. In some cases, these forces are sufficient to maintain plasma rising at 60{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}kms to heights where this velocity is comparable to the escape velocity. Forces are present in the photosphere of Betelgeuse that allow plasma to reach velocities close to the escape velocity. These mechanisms may suffice to trigger mass loss and sustain the observed large stellar winds of these evolved stars.},

Methods: Linear spectropolarimetry of the atomic lines of the spectrum of μ Cep reveals information well outside the wavelength range expected from previous models. This is interpreted as structures in expansion that are visible in the front hemisphere and sometimes also in the back hemisphere. We model the plasma distribution together with its associated velocities through an inversion algorithm to fit the observed linear polarization. Results: We find that supposing the existence of plasma beyond the limb rising high enough to be visible above it can explain the observed linear polarization signatures as well as their evolution in time. From this we are able to infer the geometric heights of the convective plumes and establish that this hot plasma rises to at least 1.1 R*. Conclusions: μ Cep appears to be in an active phase in which plasma rises often above 1.1 R*. We generalize this result to all red supergiants in a similarly evolved stage, which at certain epochs may easily send plasma to greater heights, as μ Cep appears to be doing at present. Plasma rising to such heights can easily escape the stellar gravity.},

	abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly beheved in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

The full sample contains 48 red semiregular or irregular variable stars, with a mean time-span of observations of 61 yr. We determine periods and period variability from analyses of power density spectra and time–frequency distributions. We ﬁnd two signiﬁcant periods in 18 stars. Most of these periods fall into two distinct groups, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand days. Theoretical models imply fundamental, ﬁrst and possibly second overtone mode pulsations for the shorter periods. Periods greater than 1000 d form a parallel period–luminosity relation that is similar to the long secondary periods of the asymptotic giant branch stars. A number of individual power spectra shows a single mode resolved into multiple peaks under a Lorentzian envelope, which we interpret as evidence for stochastic oscillations, presumably caused by the interplay of convection and pulsations. We ﬁnd a strong 1/f noise component in the power spectra that is remarkably similar in almost all stars of the sample. This behaviour ﬁts the picture of irregular photometric variability caused by large convection cells, analogous to the granulation background seen in the Sun.},

	abstract = {Red supergiants are the most common final evolutionary stage of stars that have initial masses between 8 and 35 times that of the Sun1. During this stage, which lasts roughly 100,000 years1, red supergiants experience substantial mass loss. However, the mechanism for this mass loss is unknown2. Mass loss may affect the evolutionary path, collapse and future supernova light curve3 of a red supergiant, and its ultimate fate as either a neutron star or a black hole4. From November 2019 to March 2020, Betelgeuse—the second-closest red supergiant to Earth (roughly 220 parsecs, or 724 light years, away)5,6—experienced a historic dimming of its visible brightness. Usually having an apparent magnitude between 0.1 and 1.0, its visual brightness decreased to 1.614 ± 0.008 magnitudes around 7–13 February 20207—an event referred to as Betelgeuse’s Great Dimming. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations showing that the southern hemisphere of Betelgeuse was ten times darker than usual in the visible spectrum during its Great Dimming. Observations and modelling support a scenario in which a dust clump formed recently in the vicinity of the star, owing to a local temperature decrease in a cool patch that appeared on the photosphere. The directly imaged brightness variations of Betelgeuse evolved on a timescale of weeks. Our findings suggest that a component of mass loss from red supergiants8 is inhomogeneous, linked to a very contrasted and rapidly changing photosphere.},

	abstract = {Betelgeuse is a pulsating red supergiant whose brightness is semi periodically variable and in February 2020 reached a historical minimum, the Great Dimming. The aims of this study are to characterize Betelgeuse’s variability based on available archival data and to study possible causes of light variability. Many spectra, from ultraviolet and optical regions, were evaluated for spectral analysis. The spectra were used primarily to determine radial velocities from different layers of atmosphere and their long-term evolution. Additionally, photometric data were analysed in different filters as well, to construct light curves and to determine periods of the variability. Spectroscopic and photometric variability are compared to each other and given into a context with the Great Dimming. The two most dominant photometric periods are P1=2190±270d and P2=417±17d, while the dominant optical (photospheric) radial velocity periods are P1,vr=2510±440d and P2,vr=415±11d. During the same time, the radial velocity determined from ultraviolet spectra also shows variability and is distinctively different from the variability of photospheric velocity, undergoing longer periods of variability. We attribute these velocities to the velocities at the base of outflowing wind. We also report a maximum of stellar wind velocity during the Great Dimming, accompanied by the previously reported minimum of brightness and the maximum of photospheric radial velocity. After the Dimming, Betelgeuse’s mode of variability has fundamentally changed and is now instead following a shorter period of ∼200d.},

Results. Our interferometric observations at low spatial frequencies are compatible with the presence of a hot spot on the photosphere that has a characteristic width of one stellar radius. It appears to be superposed on the smaller scale convective pattern. In the higher spatial frequency domain, we observe a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the observations and the predictions of 3D hydrodynamical simulations.
Conclusions. We bring new evidence for the presence of a convective pattern in the photosphere of red supergiants. The inferred hot spot is probably the top of a giant convection cell although an asymmetric extension of the star cannot be excluded by these interferometric observations alone. The properties of the observed surface features show a stronger contrast and inhomogeneity as predicted by 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulations. We propose that the large observed feature is modifying the signature of the convective pattern at the surface of the star in a way that simulations cannot reproduce.},

We use state-of-the-art three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of convection with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G photometric system. We calculate the variabiltiy, as a function of time, of the intensity-weighted mean (or the photo-center) from the synthetic maps. We then select the RSG stars in the cluster and compare their uncertainty on parallaxes to the predictions of photocentre displacements.
Results. The synthetic maps of RSG show extremely irregular and temporal variable surfaces due to convection-related dynamics. Consequentially, the position of the photo-center varies during Gaia measurements between 0.033 and 0.130 AU (≈1 to ≈5\% of the corresponding simulation stellar radius). We argue that the variability of the convection-related surface structures accounts for a substantial part of the Gaia EDR3 parallax error of the RSG sample of χ Per.
Conclusions. We suggest that the variation of the uncertainty on Gaia parallax could be exploited quantitatively using appropriate RHD simulations to extract, in a unique way, important information about the stellar dynamics and parameters of RSG stars.},

These observations of Betelgeuse reveal that a substantial surface mass ejection (SME) occurred and moved out through the extended atmosphere of the supergiant. A photospheric shock occurred in 2019 January–March, progressed through the extended atmosphere of the star during the following 11 months and led to dust production in the atmosphere. Resulting from the substantial mass outﬂow, the stellar photosphere was left with lower temperatures and the chromosphere with a lower density. The mass ejected could represent a signiﬁcant fraction of the total annual mass-loss rate from the star suggesting that episodic mass-loss events can contribute an amount comparable to that of the stellar wind. Following the SME, Betelgeuse was left with a cooler average photosphere, an unusual short photometric oscillation, reduced velocity excursions, and the disappearance of the ∼400 day pulsation in the optical and radial velocity for more than two years following the Great Dimming.},

            Betelgeuse is a well-known bright red supergiant that shows semiregular variations with four approximate periods of 2200, 420, 230, and 185 d. While the longest period was customarily regarded as long secondary period of unknown origin, we identify the ∼2200-d period as the radial fundamental mode, and the three shorter periods as the radial first, second, and third overtones. From a linear non-adiabatic pulsation analysis including the pulsation/convection coupling, we have found that these radial pulsation modes are all excited in the envelope of a model in a late stage of the core carbon burning. Models with similar pulsation property have masses of \$11{\textbackslash}sim 12{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (\$19{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at zero-age main sequence) with luminosities (log L/L⊙ = 5.27 ∼ 5.28) and effective temperatures (log Teff ≈ 3.53) that are consistent with the range of the observational determinations. We also find that a synthetic light curve obtained by adding the fundamental and the first-overtone mode is comparable with the light curve of Betelgeuse up to the Great Dimming. We conclude that Betelgeuse is likely in the late stage of core carbon burning, and a good candidate for the next Galactic Type II supernova.},

              We conduct a rigorous examination of the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse by drawing on the synthesis of new observational data and three different modeling techniques. Our observational results include the release of new, processed photometric measurements collected with the space-based Solar Mass Ejection Imager instrument prior to Betelgeuse’s recent, unprecedented dimming event. We detect the first radial overtone in the photometric data and report a period of 185 ± 13.5 days. Our theoretical predictions include self-consistent results from multi-timescale evolutionary, oscillatory, and hydrodynamic simulations conducted with the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics software suite. Significant outcomes of our modeling efforts include a precise prediction for the star’s radius:

Seismic results from both perturbed hydrostatic and evolving hydrodynamic simulations constrain the period and driving mechanisms of Betelgeuse’s dominant periodicities in new ways.

	abstract = {Approximately 25\%–30\% of pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars show long secondary periods (LSPs) of typical length \$400–1500 days, roughly 10 times longer than the primary period of pulsation. Here we seek an explanation for the LSPs. We describe the spectral variations over a 4 yr interval for three of these stars. The radial velocity is found to vary during the LSP with full amplitude of \$5 km sÀ1, a result similar to that found by Hinkle and coworkers for six other variables of this type. Variations in the H and Na D line proﬁles throughout the LSP suggest that chromospheric activity and mass loss vary with the period of the LSP. Possible explanations for the photometric and radial velocity variations include eccentric motion of an orbiting companion of mass \$0.1 M, radial and nonradial pulsation, rotation of an ellipsoidal-shaped red giant, episodic dust ejection, and star spot cycles. We discuss each of these models and show that they all have problems. The most likely explanation is that the LSPs result from a low degree g+ mode conﬁned to the outer radiative layers of the red giant, combined with large-scale star spot activity to give the observed chromosphere and the irregularity of the light curve. We suggest that these stars may be the precursors of asymmetric planetary nebulae.},

	abstract = {The processes that shape the extended atmospheres of red supergiants, heat their chromospheres, create molecular reservoirs, drive mass loss, and create dust remain poorly understood. Betelgeuse’s V-band “Great Dimming” event of 2019 September/2020 February and its subsequent rapid brightening provides a rare opportunity to study these phenomena. Two different explanations have emerged to explain the dimming; new dust appeared in our line of sight attenuating the photospheric light, or a large portion of the photosphere had cooled. Here we present ﬁve years of Wing three-ﬁlter (A, B, and C band) TiO and near-IR photometry obtained at the Wasatonic Observatory. These reveal that parts of the photosphere had a mean effective temperature (Teff) signiﬁcantly lower than that found by Levesque \& Massey. Synthetic photometry from MARCS-model photospheres and spectra reveal that the V band, TiO index, and C-band photometry, and previously reported 4000–6800 Å spectra can be quantitatively reproduced if there are multiple photospheric components, as hinted at by Very Large Telescope (VLT)-SPHERE images in Montargès et al. If the cooler component has ΔTeff250 K cooler than 3650 K, then no new dust is required to explain the available empirical constraints. A coincidence of the dominant short- (∼430 days) and longperiod (∼5.8 yr) V-band variations occurred near the time of deep minimum (Guinan et al. 2019a). This is in tandem with the strong correlation of V mag and photospheric radial velocities, recently reported by Dupree et al. (2020b). These suggest that the cooling of a large fraction of the visible star has a dynamic origin related to the photospheric motions, perhaps arising from pulsation or large-scale convective motions.},
